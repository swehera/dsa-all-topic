/*
An array garbage value in C++ is a value that is stored in an array element but is not initialized properly. This can happen when an array element is declared but not assigned a value, or when an array element is assigned a value that is outside of its range.

Here are some examples of array garbage values in C++:
*/  


  
  int x[4]; // x is declared but not initialized
  cout << x[0] << endl; // This will print a garbage value
  cout << x[1] << endl; // This will print a garbage value
  cout << x[2] << endl; // This will print a garbage value
  cout << x[3] << endl; // This will print a garbage value



  
  return 0;
}
